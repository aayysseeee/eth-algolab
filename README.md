# eth-algolab
Please not that this is a very special kind of lecture at ETH. If you think this is ugly, unusable and all in just garbage â€“ well, yes, you're right. However, this is the whole idea of the lecture. To just dump some algorithm for some problem without thinking of any casualties!

Anyway, maybe this is useful to some of the ETH students :-)
